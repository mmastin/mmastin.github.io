[BnBalyze](https://bnbalyze.netlify.com/), a collaboration project with four Data Scientists and seven Web Developers, utilizes data from 22,522 AirBnB listings in Berlin from November 2018 to predict an optimal price based on key features. Our hypothetical customer owns several properties, some of which are priced too low, leaving extra revenue on the table, and some of which are priced too high, leading to low occupancy rates.

Starting with a dataset of 96 features, we settled on a model with nine key features:

We ran a combination of exploratory regression models -- Random Forest, XGBoost, Keras Neural Network -- all had similar accuracy scores, but we used a hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest as the final backend version because of feature explainability and a preference for returning common AirBnB prices such as $40 and not overly specific amounts like $39.15.
