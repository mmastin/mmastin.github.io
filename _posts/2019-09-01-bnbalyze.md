Better Reads, a book recommendation website based on a natural language processing model powered by spaCy and Elastic Beanstalk, was my first collaborative project with three other data scientists and six web developers.  Unfortunately, we pulled the plug on the AWS-hosted backend due to mounting costs, [but the website is still available on Netlify](https://better-reads-marketing.netlify.com/).
