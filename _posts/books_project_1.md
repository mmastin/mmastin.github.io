Physical book sales are once again increasing after years of decline amidst disillusionment with social media and mobile-centered lives. While TwitteAPIs, Facebook Analytics, and Google offer an endless torrent of data, the book market also offers insights into the Zeitgeist.

According to a sample of 54,000 Amazon e-book titles, the chance of a book rated at less than 3 stars selling a considerable number of copies is miniscule. Highly-related genre fiction makes up the majority of sales.

Books rated below 4 stars made up 19.4% of titles and 17.6% of gross sales, while books below 3 stars made up 5.6% of sales — indicating that both customers tend to give positive ratings and sellers are incentivized to game the ratings system with fake positive reviews.

Project Gutenberg is ‘a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, founded in 1971 as the world’s oldest digital library.’ I analyzed a dataset detailing their most popular 1,000 downloads.

Half of them total 65,000 words or less. The truly long books, over half a million words, are the domain of religion (The King James Bible, The Mahabharata, Antiquities of the Jews), lifetime compendiums (The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, Essays of Michel de Montaigne, The Journals of Lewis and Clark), infamously intricate novels (War and Peace, Les Misérables), and curiously, a Victorian-era self- and home-improvement book, Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management.

Statistics, unfortunately, aren’t readily available on the proportion of readers who ambitiously start these tomes only to quickly and indefinitely put them aside.

Most sentences in the books cluster around a normal distribution of just under 20 words per sentence. Extremely verbose outliers predictably include philosophical classics: Aristotle’s Politics: A Treatise on Government and René Descartes’ Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One’s Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences.

Post-war science fiction dominates the low end of the spectrum of under ten words per sentence, including Mr. Spaceship and The Variable Man by Philip K. Dick.
